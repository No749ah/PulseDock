# PulseDock Backlog

## In Progress

_(nothing active — pick from Next Up)_

## Recently Completed

- [x] **CLI tool** — `pulsedock check <url>` one-shot HTTP checker + `monitors list/check` + `config` commands. New package `@pulsedock/cli` with 10 unit tests, fully wired into root build/test, documented in `docs/CLI.md`.
- [x] **Mobile-responsive PWA improvements** — Added contextual loading skeletons for Monitors/Dashboard/Alerts, installability banner (`beforeinstallprompt` + iOS hint), service worker registration, and offline fallback route (`/offline`) with cached offline support.
- [x] **Add proper API versioning strategy** — Implemented v2 API surface: `GET /v2/monitors` (paginated + filtering + sorting), `GET /v2/alert-channels` (paginated + usedByCount + secret redaction), `GET /v2/checks` (paginated check history + date-range + level filters), `GET /v2/system/info`, `GET /v2/system/versions`. v1 unchanged. 89 integration tests passing.
- [x] **Plugin system for custom monitor types** — Delivered plugin contracts/registry/sandbox + plugin execution path, added starter plugin (`http.response-match`), exposed plugin metadata + config UX in Monitors UI, and documented packaging/verification flow (`docs/PLUGINS.md`).
- [x] **Docker Compose / Kubernetes manifests for production** — Added production deployment docs, fixed compose prod env keys, and shipped baseline Kubernetes manifests (`k8s/base` + `k8s/overlays/prod`) with ingress/service/deployment/statefulset resources.
- [x] **WebSocket support for real-time monitor updates** — Added server push for check + alert activity (`monitor.checked`, `alert.triggered`) and frontend live subscriptions on Dashboard/Monitors with immediate UI updates.

## Next Up (Priority Order)

### High Priority
_(CLI done — see Recently Completed)_

### Blocked/In Review
- [ ] **Fix all npm audit vulnerabilities** (**BLOCKED**: 4 HIGH severity in hono <= 4.12.6 via @prisma/dev; npm audit fix --force downgrades prisma to 6.19.2 with breaking changes; waiting on upstream hono/prisma fixes)

### Nice-to-Have
- [ ] **Browser extension** — One-click monitor creation from current tab URL with quick check presets. Estimated impact: Medium (activation).

### Completed Phases (Reference)

#### Phase 1: Refactor & Harden
✅ **Phase 1: Refactor & Harden** — Tailwind migration, TypeScript strict mode, security (helmet/CORS/CSP), input validation, structured logging, auth hardening
✅ **Phase 2: Landing & Login** — Apple-like design, Framer Motion animations, dark theme, metadata/OG tags, responsive
✅ **Phase 3: Dashboard & App UI** — All 9 pages with CRUD, glassmorphism cards, dark theme, proper layouts
✅ **Phase 4: API & Backend** — 74 tests passing, Swagger docs, health/metrics endpoints, integration tests
✅ **Phase 5: DevOps & Docs** — Docker (dev+prod), GitHub Actions CI/CD, README/CHANGELOG/CONTRIBUTING
✅ **Phase 6: Features** — All notification channels, public status pages, API keys, import/export, dark/light toggle, visual UI/UX audit

## Status Summary
- **Codebase:** 89 tests passing, zero TypeScript errors, dark/light theme toggle, responsive design on all 9 pages + PWA install/offline UX
- **Build:** ✅ Clean builds, all dependencies locked, Docker setup working
- **Deployment:** GitHub Actions CI/CD running, reverse proxy nginx setup documented
- **Production Readiness:** ~99% — Core features stable, full v2 API + PWA baseline, deployment includes compose + k8s + plugin system; primary gap is upstream audit fixes

## Ideas & Future Work
- Browser extension for quick monitor creation
- CLI tool (`pulsedock check <url>`)
- Mobile-responsive PWA
- Multi-tenant support
